# Zack Snyder's Justice League's Field Day on Twitter
The Snyder Cut was largely the result of an internet sensation and a big part of this was on Twitter. So I set out to explore just how important social media
was in making Zack Snyder's Justice League a reality. 
The dataset of tweets was sourced via Twitter's API and a complete sentiment analysis pipeline was implemented, answering the following questions:

1. What was the general sentiment of tweets?
2. Named Entity Recognition- Who did the tweets talk about?
3. Who were the most mentioned characters in the tweets?

And btw, the Snyder Cut was amazing!
