# Zack Snyder's Justice League's Field Day on Twitter
The Snyder Cut was largely the result of an internet sensation and a big part of this was on Twitter. So I set out to explore just how important social media
was in making Zack Snyder's Justice League a reality. 
The dataset of tweets was sourced via Twitter's API and a complete sentiment analysis pipeline was implemented, answering the following questions:

1. What was the general sentiment of tweets?
2. Named Entity Recognition- Who did the tweets talk about?
3. Who were the most mentioned characters in the tweets?
4. What words were used together most frequently in the corpus?

And btw, the Snyder Cut was amazing!
